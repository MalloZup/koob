# koob

Koob (book in reverse mode), is a simple javascript page which is intended to be:

- minimalistic
- learning journey/hack project within javascript

Its main intent is to do things with web-bookmarks:

* 1) Write:
- accept a web-page link and a mandatory tag ( for simplicity sake just only a tag is possible)

* 2) Visualize:

- visualize bookmarks depending on the tag.

Example:

if I want to add a bookmark, for golang blogpost, I will need to add tag "code".


# Constraints:

There is no optimisation on tag duplicates etc. This is left to the user of koob
